    "There are many ways of describing a probability distribution. However two of the most common ways are to talk about its:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Center\n",
    "2. Spread\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Center\n",
    "\n",
    "The \"center\" of a distribution is where the \"balance\" of the distribution is. An intuitive way to think about it: imagine if you had a lump of Play-Doh that was shaped like the probability distribution. Where would you have to put your finger on the base of the Play-Doh in order for it to perfectly balance?\n",
    "\n",
    "That's the \"center of mass\" of the probability distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many ways of describing the \"center\" of data in more mathematical ways, however. Here are the three you want to know:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The `mean`\n",
    "* The `mean`: This is also known as the `average`. It's mathematically computed in the following way:\n",
    "    \n",
    "$$ \\frac{\\Sigma_{i=1}^{N}d_i}{numData} $$ for each datapoint $d_i$ in your dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are new to reading mathematical notation in the above, $\\Sigma$ is the Greek letter capital `sigma` and it means \"summation\". So the numerator $\\Sigma_{i=1}^{N}d_i$ is read as: \"the sum of all $d_i$ starting at $d_1$ and ending at $d_N$\"\n",
    "\n",
    "The numerator is a mathematicians way of writing the following `for-loop`:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "total = 0\n",
    "for i in range(0, N):\n",
    "    d_i = data[i] # the i-th element in your list `data`\n",
    "    total += d_i\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The `median`\n",
    "* The `median`: This is different from the mean. The `median` is the number at the 50th percentile of your data. It's the number that represents the point where, 50% of the data is above that point and 50% is below. It's the \"halfway point`. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, here is a list of salaries for employees at a small company:\n",

    "salaries = [40000, 29000, 35500, 31100]\n",

    "```python\n",
    "median = (29000 + 31100) / 2.0\n",
    "```\n",
